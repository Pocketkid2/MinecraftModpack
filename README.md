# Adam's Minecraft Modpack

Based on "The 1.12.2 Pack" (v1.6.5) from the Technic Launcher

### Changes
1. [ThermalDynamics](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/thermal-dynamics) has been updated to a custom fork maintained by me. The only change at the moment is that I added fun sounds to viaducts.
2. [OpenBlocks](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/openblocks) has been updated to a custom fork maintained by me. The only change at the moment is that I updated the grave feature to store full XP points in addition to inventory items.

### Additions
1. [Building Gadgets](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/building-gadgets) - adds a replacing gadget and building gadget which are extremely useful for large creations
2. [Storage Drawers](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/storage-drawers) (+ Chameleon library) - adds super high density mass storage of individual items via "drawers"
3. [Light Level Overlay](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/light-level-overlay-reloaded) - Press F4 to see the light level (0-15) of all flat surfaces, to determine if mobs can spawn (the color indicates mob spawning ability, unless you already know that 7 or lower can spawn mobs)
4. [Optifine](https://optifine.net/home) - helps with framerate and adds some other fun things like zoom by pressing C
5. [MalisisDoors](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/malisisdoors) + [MalisisBlocks](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/malisisblocks) (+ MalisisCore library) - Fancier doors and things like player sensors
7. [Flan's mod](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/flans-mod-5-5-2) with all official content packs - Lots of guns and military vehicles, but in Minecraft!
